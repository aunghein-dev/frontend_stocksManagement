## Technologies Used

**Frontend:**

- **Next.js:** A powerful React framework for production, offering server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **React:** For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and consistent styling.
- **React Query:** For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- **Formik/Yup:** For streamlined form management and validation.

**Backend:**

- **Spring Boot:** A robust framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Java:** The primary programming language.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database.
- **Supabase:** A Backend-as-a-Service providing authentication, real-time database, and more.
- **Spring Data JPA:** For easy data access with relational databases.
- **Spring Security:** For comprehensive authentication and authorization with JWT.
- **Lombok:** To reduce boilerplate code.

## Architecture

The Openware Stock Manager employs a microservices-inspired architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend (Next.js):** Manages the user interface, routing, and client-side logic. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend (Spring Boot):** Provides the core business logic, data persistence, and API endpoints. It interacts directly with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores all application data.
- **Supabase:** Primarily used for its **authentication capabilities**, acting as an identity provider, and potentially for real-time features if integrated. The `account_id` is a crucial element in the JWT, enabling the backend to filter data for the correct tenant within the single PostgreSQL database.

**Tenant Isolation (Single DB Multi-Tenancy):**  
Each customer account has a unique `account_id` embedded within the JWT upon successful authentication. All database queries made by the Spring Boot backend include a filter based on this `account_id`, ensuring strict data isolation between tenants within the same PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **Yarn**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 17 or higher recommended)
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (for Spring Boot backend)
- **PostgreSQL** database instance
- **Supabase Account** (for authentication and other services)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repositories:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aunghein-dev/frontend_stocksManagement.git
git clone https://github.com/aunghein-dev/backend_stocksManagement.git
```

2. **Frontend Installation:**

```bash
cd frontend_stocksManagement
npm install # or yarn install
```

3. **Backend Installation:**

```bash
cd backend_stocksManagement
# If using Maven:
mvn clean install
# If using Gradle:
./gradlew clean build
```

### Configuration

#### PostgreSQL Database

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database for Openware Stock Manager:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE openware_stock_manager;
```

2. Update the database connection details in the backend's `application.properties` (or `application.yml`):

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openware_stock_manager
spring.datasource.username=_pg_username
spring.datasource.password=_pg_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

#### Supabase

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Configure authentication settings (e.g., enable email/password login).
3. Get Supabase Project URL and Anon Key.
4. Update the frontend `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

5. Add Supabase JWT secret to backend config:

```properties
app.jwt.supabase-secret=_SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
```

#### Environment Variables (General)

Make sure to define all required variables in `.env` files for both frontend and backend.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend:**

```bash
cd backend_stocksManagement
mvn spring-boot:run # or ./gradlew bootRun
```

2. **Start the Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend_stocksManagement
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser.

- **Sign Up / Log In:** Auth via Supabase.
- **Manage Products:** Create/edit products.
- **Process Orders:** Use POS-like order flow.

---

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Deploy via Vercel, Netlify, or server.
- **Backend:** Deploy via Heroku, EC2, Cloud Run, etc.
- **Database:** Use PostgreSQL managed service.
- **Supabase:** Hosted automatically.

**Production Tips:**

- Set `ddl-auto=none` or `validate`
- Configure CORS and secure env vars
- Add logging and monitoring
